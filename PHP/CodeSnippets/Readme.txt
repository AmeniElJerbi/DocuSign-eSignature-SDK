This sample code requires a DocuSign DevCenter account. If you do not
already have a DevCenter account please go to
http://www.docusign.com/devcenter/ and sign up for one. This sample will
not function without a valid DevCenter account.

This sample includes the executable source code for the PHP code snippets
that are in our API documentation. 

Installation and Use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deployment is just copying the entire CodeSnippts directory into your
htdocs (or equivalent) directory on your server.

Uncomment the methods you want to try out in the index.php file. Search the
ApiServiceSnippets.php file for tasks labeled "TODO:" and fill in the
requested configuration items. Then, point your web browser to somthing
like "http://localhost/CodeSnippets/index.php". You'll see the resulting
return data in your browser if all the configuration data is correct.

Happy Coding!
