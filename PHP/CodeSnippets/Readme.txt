This sample code requires a DocuSign DevCenter account. If you do not
already have a DevCenter account please go to
http://www.docusign.com/devcenter/ and sign up for one. This sample will
not function without a valid DevCenter account.

This sample includes the executable source code for the PHP code snippets
that are in our API documentation. 

Installation and Use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deployment is just copying the entire CodeSnippts directory into your
htdocs (or equivalent) directory on your server.

Uncomment the methods you want to try out in the
index_of_api_sample_functions.php and index_of_ams_sample_functions.php
files. Search the ApiServiceSnippets.php and AccountManagementSnippets.php
files for tasks labeled "TODO:" and fill in the requested configuration
items. Search include/creds.php and include/utils.php for"TODO:" tasks to
fill in your credentials and timezone. Then, point your web browser to
something like
"http://localhost/CodeSnippets/index_of_api_sample_functions.php". You'll
see the resulting return data in your browser if all the configuration data
is correct.

Happy Coding!
