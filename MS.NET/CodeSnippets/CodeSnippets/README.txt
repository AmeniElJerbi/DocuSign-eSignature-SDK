To run these tests, you need to:
	1. Install the NUnit framework and configure for use with Visual Studio
	2. Replace the placeholder credentials in the app.config appsettings section with your demo credentials
	3. Replace any placeholder strings (usually for email IDs or template IDs, especially within CreateOneSigner) within CodeSnippets.cs
