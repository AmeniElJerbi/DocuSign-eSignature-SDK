              <strong>Legal Compliance</strong>
              <br />
              DocuSign &reg; exceeds all Federal ESIGN Legislation (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act) requirements.  The law states that, “In effect no contract can be denied on the basis that it is electronic, and when executed correctly, electronic contracts should be treated like any other contract under ordinary contract law.” This legislation has since been tested successfully by Microsoft, AOL and other corporations that have prosecuted and won lawsuits where consumers attempted to renege on signed electronic contracts. Today, consumers sign online contracts every day, including website agreements and online stock trading accounts. DocuSign, Inc., was founded to extend this model to all documents sent by businesses for signature or certification. DocuSign provides the secure knowledge that signed electronic agreements will have the same legal effect as signed offline agreements.
